# - Try to find Graphviz
# Once done this will define
#
#  GRAPHVIZ_FOUND - system has Graphviz
#  GRAPHVIZ_INCLUDE_DIRS - Graphviz include directories
#  GRAPHVIZ_CDT_LIBRARY - Graphviz CDT library
#  GRAPHVIZ_GVC_LIBRARY - Graphviz GVC library
#  GRAPHVIZ_CGRAPH_LIBRARY - Graphviz CGRAPH library
#  GRAPHVIZ_PATHPLAN_LIBRARY - Graphviz PATHPLAN library
#  GRAPHVIZ_VERSION - Graphviz version
#
# This module reads hints about search locations from the following cmake variables:
#  GRAPHVIZ_ROOT          - Graphviz installation prefix
#                           (containing bin/, include/, etc.)
